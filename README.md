# AbHAC R package 

## AbHAC: Aberration Hub analysis of Cancer


AbHAC is an R package for implementation of a simplistic approach for analysis of 
cancer genomics datasets in context of protein interaction networks. Each protein in the whole proteome
network (interactome) is considered an individual subnetwork and based density of deregulated molecules at genomic
or transcriptomic levels among neighborhood of that protein as well as the whole interactome, a fisher's exact test
p-value is calculated. Full documentation is going to be available soon.


### Nomenclature:

In [old irish](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/abhac), abhac means a dwarf star.
