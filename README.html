		<h1>AbHAC: Cancer Genomics Network Enrichment Analysis</h1>
		<p> AbHAC is an R package for implementation of a simplistic approach for analysis of 
		cancer genomics datasets in context of protein interaction networks. Each protein in the whole proteome
		network (interactome) is considered an individual subnetwork and based density of deregulated molecules at genomic
		or transcriptomic levels among neighborhood of that protein as well as the whole interactome, a fisher's exact test
		p-value is calculated. Full documentation is going to be available soon.</p>
		<h3>Nomenclature:</h3>
		<p>In <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/abhac">old Irish</a>, abhac means a dwarf star.</p>
